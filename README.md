# Bank-Customer-Churn-Dataset EDA

About the Dataset:
This Dataset contains the information about the customers(10000+ customers) that have an
account in the bank, their credit scores, the country they belong to, their gender, age, their
tenure, their current balance deposited in the bank, products/policies/Term deposits that they
have enrolled for in the bank, whether they have a credit card or not, whether they have been
an active member or not, what’s their estimated salary, and finally the most important column
that is whether they’ll be churned out of the bank or not.

What are the insights I want to retrieve
from the dataset?
❖ Get a general understanding of what are the reasons due to which the customers are
churned out of the bank.
❖ What is the biggest cause for the bank to remove a particular customer?
❖ How are the various colums correlated to each other?
❖ What is the age group that is being churned out of the bank?
❖ Which gender is the one that is being churned out more?
❖ What is the number of customers out of the total that are being churned out?
❖ The most important outcome that I am looking forward to get out of this project is
to at last be able to predict that if a new customer arrives in the bank’s dataset
whether he’ll be churned out of the bank or not, to predict the possibility of him
being churned out.
